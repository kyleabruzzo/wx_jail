# NOTICE
This script is 100% functional and ready to be used on your server BUT:
- I made this script for one of the servers I've been developing
- Some of the functions are taken from qalle's jail system
- There might be some translation errors and/or untranslated parts (mostly in czech), however I've tried to translate most of the parts
